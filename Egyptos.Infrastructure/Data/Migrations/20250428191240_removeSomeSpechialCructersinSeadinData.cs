It also highlights Egypt's trade relations, mining, and shipbuilding, and the importance of Suez for pilgrimages to the Holy Land. In addition, a hall has been dedicated to documenting the struggle of the people of Suez against the British occupation, as well as during the October 1973 Battle.

The Egyptian economy flourished to an astonishing degree, and most of the most famous and impressive ancient Egyptian monuments date back to this great period.  The Eighteenth Dynasty (1550-1295 BC) began with King Ahmose, who expelled the Hyksos, a Semitic people who ruled most of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. Most of the kings of the New Kingdom pursued an expansionist foreign policy in response to what had happened before, and the wealth generated by the expansions was used to carry out many construction projects throughout Egypt, especially at the Karnak Temple in Luxor, the most important temple of Amun, the lord of Thebes. Most of the kings of this dynasty were buried in the famous Valley of the Kings.  Art, architecture, and the national economy reached new heights under Hatshepsut. Unfortunately, her husband, Thutmose II, did not rule for long, while his son from another wife, Thutmose III, was still too young to rule. So the Great Royal Wife Hatshepsut, perhaps in order to secure the throne of Egypt, declared herself king alongside her young stepson. Hatshepsut developed a new concept of kingship and linked herself to a divine birth from the god Amun to legitimize her reign, leaving a profound mark on the geographic, religious, and political landscape of Thebes.  Thutmose III proved to be the most capable king of all. During his reign, Egypt’s borders were extended farther, and his influence extended throughout the Nile Valley, including Nubia, leaving many monuments at the Karnak Temple, as Hatshepsut had done before. Peace was achieved in the region during the reign of his son Amenhotep II, and both the state of peace and increased international trade bore fruit under his successor Amenhotep III. Few kings matched him in the quality, scale, and quantity of his building projects, as he built many structures throughout Egypt and Nubia, including half of the Luxor Temple as it stands today.  However, Amenhotep IV, son of Amenhotep III, changed his name to Akhenaten and declared his rebellion against the rest of the gods and that there is only one god, Aten, who was represented as the sun disk in the sky. His reign witnessed other revolutionary changes in royal ideology, art, architecture and language. However, he neglected Egypt's foreign affairs, and by the end of his reign, Egypt's lands in the Levant (the area of ​​Palestine, Lebanon and Syria) were lost.  A turbulent period followed his reign, with Horemheb - a former army commander - ascending to the throne and completing the return of things to normal, appointing the commander Bar-Amesu as his successor. With his ascension to the throne under the name Ramesses I, the Nineteenth Dynasty (c. 1295-1186 BC) began, and his son Seti I succeeded him and ushered in an era of prosperity in Egypt. He also carried out many military campaigns, the most important of which were against the Hittites, who emerged as a new power in the ancient Near East, and regained much of Egypt's lost lands in the Levant.  His son Ramses II the Great was one of the most successful kings in ancient Egyptian history. During his long reign he waged many successful wars, achieved the first peace treaty with the Hittites, and left more monuments throughout Egypt than any other king. Meanwhile, his successor and son Merneptah launched a major attack against tribes called the \"Sea Peoples\", and by the end of his reign the Nineteenth Dynasty declined.  With the reign of King Setnakht, founder of the Twentieth Dynasty (1896-1069 BC), order returned to the country, and his son Ramses III was the last great warrior of the New Kingdom. After him, the state deteriorated steadily until it was divided into two parts. The next dynasty ruled only Lower Egypt, while Upper Egypt remained under the rule of the priests. The New Kingdom");

King Djoser, the first king of the Third Dynasty, built his step pyramid in Saqqara. He wanted to build a mastaba-shaped tomb in the style of his predecessors, the kings of the First and Second Dynasties, but those mastabas increased to reach about five mastabas, one above the other.To be the first stone step pyramid in the country's history. But his successors were unable to complete their pyramids, perhaps due to the short duration of their rule. We do not know much about King Huni, the first king of the Fourth Dynasty, while the second king, Senefru (2613-2589 BC), was very powerful and advanced. He alone built three pyramids, the first of which was in the city of Meidum, which began as a step pyramid and then ended as a complete pyramid. . As for the second, he built it in Dahshur and is known as the Bent Pyramid or the Broken Pyramid. It was the first attempt to build a pyramid.Complete, but its construction was not completed as he wanted, while the third pyramid, known as the Red Pyramid in Dahshur, was the first complete pyramid in Egypt, which opened the way for the construction of complete pyramids. This was achieved during the reign of his successor, King Khufu (c. 2589 - 2566 BC), who built the largest pyramid and pyramid group. The Great Pyramid, with an original height of 146.5 metres, was the tallest building in the world for 3,800 years. Khufu's son and successor, Ra (about 2566 - 2558 BC), did not complete his pyramid at Abu Rawash. He was succeeded by Khafre (ca. 2555 - 2532 BC), during whose reign he carved the Great Sphinx and built a pyramid nearly the size of his father's pyramid. As for the two temples connected to the pyramid, they were larger and more detailed than the temples of its predecessors. The pyramid of Menkaure (2532 - 2503 BC), son of King Khafre, is considered an example of the beginning of the decline of royal authority. Although his pyramid was considerably smaller than its predecessors, at least a quarter of it was covered in granite, a stone brought from Aswan that was difficult to obtain and transport. Moreover, the temples adjacent to his temple are relatively larger than their predecessors, indicating a shift in the king's priorities from his tomb to the worship to be practiced in these temples. This trend grew more pronounced during the Fifth Dynasty (ca. 2449 - 2487 BC) and the Sixth Dynasty (ca. 2345 - 1821 BC). The last king of the Fifth Dynasty, Unas, ordered the creation of inscriptions inside his pyramid at Saqqara, known as the Pyramid Texts, an introduction to a famous series of texts known as the Book of the Dead. The purpose of these texts was to help the king successfully reach the afterlife and become a deity. Beginning in the Sixth Dynasty it became clear that the king's authority had declined. In addition to other factors, by the end of the long reign of its last king, Pipi II (c. 278-2184 BC), Egypt was no longer under the control of a central government.");

The Eleventh Dynasty came from Thebes (now Luxor). It was not an important city during that period, but it will become one of the most prominent and important cities in Egypt during the rest of ancient Egyptian history Because of his Theban origins, Nebhepetre-Mentuhotep was buried on the western mainland of Thebes in the Deir el-Bahri area. His tomb included a temple for his funeral rituals. The tomb was partly cut into a rocky slope, while part of it was built in the form of a terrace that included an ascending middle slope. This temple was clearly a partial inspiration for the neighboring and more famous temple of Queen Hatshepsut to its immediate left. Little is known about Mentuhotep III and IV, the last rulers of the Eleventh Dynasty. Amenemhat I (1985-1955 BC) was the first king of the Twelfth Dynasty (1985-1795 BC) and was probably the vizier of Mentuhotep IV. The kings of this highly successful dynasty consolidated the authority of the central government over all of Egypt, and during this period the powerful provincial rulers were reined in.They also undertook building projects throughout the country, strengthened its borders, sent mining expeditions, and encouraged trade voyages. A series of forts, such as those at Bohn, Semna and Ascot, not only served as defensive fortresses but regulated the movement of incoming Nubian traders and were bases for mining and military operations. The reign of Kings Senusret III (1874-1855 BC) and Amenemhat III (1850-1808 BC) was particularly prosperous. Huge agricultural projects were implemented during that period, especially in the Fayoum region in Central Egypt, where canals were dug, part of the lake was dredged, and the resulting lands were reclaimed for agriculture. The kings of the Twelfth Dynasty in this region were buried in huge pyramids near the new capital founded by Amenemhat I, which was called Etet Tawi, meaning the Holder of the Two Lands, and its exact location is still unknown. The Middle Kingdom represented an important shift in the history of ancient Egyptian culture, as its most important contributions to ancient Egyptian language and literature were: new linguistic structures emerged and many new literary texts were written, many of which remain popular for more than a millennium. The language used to write these texts, with its grammatical rules, is called the Middle Egyptian language, which will serve as the language of official texts until the Ptolemaic era (332-30 BC) and the Roman era (30 BC - 395 AD).");

This is the period in which Egypt emerged as a unified political entity, making it the oldest country in the world Before the formation of the Egyptian state and during the Neolithic, an increasing homogeneity can be seen between the different civilizations that emerged along the Nile Valley, with those civilizations being named after their original sites. Among the most important of them is the Maadi civilization (4000 - 3100 BC) in Lower Egypt. The Badari civilization (ca. 500-4000 BC) near Asyut and Naqada I (ca. 4000-3500 BC) in Upper Egypt near Luxor. Like the rest of its contemporaries, Naqada I reveals little about social stratification, but this changed by the end of this period. This trend became more evident during Naqada II (ca. 3500 - 3200 BC), which began to spread along the Nile Valley.

The transition from the Naqada III civilization to the early dynastic period was smooth, which is why Naqada III is sometimes called the “Zero Dynasty.” It appears that the powerful regional leaders during this period already controlled most, if not all, of the land of Egypt. There was a difference between Upper and Lower Egypt geographically. This difference remained apparent until the late prehistoric era, and the ancient Egyptians did not forget this matter throughout their ancient history despite the unity.

The Egyptian economy flourished to an astonishing degree, and most of the most famous and impressive ancient Egyptian monuments date back to this great period.\r\n\r\nThe Eighteenth Dynasty (1550-1295 BC) began with King Ahmose, who expelled the Hyksos, a Semitic people who ruled most of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. Most of the kings of the New Kingdom pursued an expansionist foreign policy in response to what had happened before, and the wealth generated by the expansions was used to carry out many construction projects throughout Egypt, especially at the Karnak Temple in Luxor, the most important temple of Amun, the lord of Thebes. Most of the kings of this dynasty were buried in the famous Valley of the Kings.\r\n\r\nArt, architecture, and the national economy reached new heights under Hatshepsut. Unfortunately, her husband, Thutmose II, did not rule for long, while his son from another wife, Thutmose III, was still too young to rule. So the Great Royal Wife Hatshepsut, perhaps in order to secure the throne of Egypt, declared herself king alongside her young stepson. Hatshepsut developed a new concept of kingship and linked herself to a divine birth from the god Amun to legitimize her reign, leaving a profound mark on the geographic, religious, and political landscape of Thebes.\r\n\r\nThutmose III proved to be the most capable king of all. During his reign, Egypt’s borders were extended farther, and his influence extended throughout the Nile Valley, including Nubia, leaving many monuments at the Karnak Temple, as Hatshepsut had done before. Peace was achieved in the region during the reign of his son Amenhotep II, and both the state of peace and increased international trade bore fruit under his successor Amenhotep III. Few kings matched him in the quality, scale, and quantity of his building projects, as he built many structures throughout Egypt and Nubia, including half of the Luxor Temple as it stands today.\r\n\r\nHowever, Amenhotep IV, son of Amenhotep III, changed his name to Akhenaten and declared his rebellion against the rest of the gods and that there is only one god, Aten, who was represented as the sun disk in the sky. His reign witnessed other revolutionary changes in royal ideology, art, architecture and language. However, he neglected Egypt's foreign affairs, and by the end of his reign, Egypt's lands in the Levant (the area of ​​Palestine, Lebanon and Syria) were lost.\r\n\r\nA turbulent period followed his reign, with Horemheb - a former army commander - ascending to the throne and completing the return of things to normal, appointing the commander Bar-Amesu as his successor. With his ascension to the throne under the name Ramesses I, the Nineteenth Dynasty (c. 1295-1186 BC) began, and his son Seti I succeeded him and ushered in an era of prosperity in Egypt. He also carried out many military campaigns, the most important of which were against the Hittites, who emerged as a new power in the ancient Near East, and regained much of Egypt's lost lands in the Levant.\r\n\r\nHis son Ramses II the Great was one of the most successful kings in ancient Egyptian history. During his long reign he waged many successful wars, achieved the first peace treaty with the Hittites, and left more monuments throughout Egypt than any other king. Meanwhile, his successor and son Merneptah launched a major attack against tribes called the \"Sea Peoples\", and by the end of his reign the Nineteenth Dynasty declined.\r\n\r\nWith the reign of King Setnakht, founder of the Twentieth Dynasty (1896-1069 BC), order returned to the country, and his son Ramses III was the last great warrior of the New Kingdom. After him, the state deteriorated steadily until it was divided into two parts.

He alone built three pyramids, the first of which was in the city of Meidum, which began as a step pyramid and then ended as a complete pyramid. . As for the second, he built it in Dahshur and is known as the Bent Pyramid or the Broken Pyramid. It was the first attempt to build a pyramid.Complete, but its construction was not completed as he wanted, while the third pyramid, known as the Red Pyramid in Dahshur, was the first complete pyramid in Egypt, which opened the way for the construction of complete pyramids. This was achieved during the reign of his successor, King Khufu (c. 2589 - 2566 BC), who built the largest pyramid and pyramid group. The Great Pyramid, with an original height of 146.5 metres, was the tallest building in the world for 3,800 years. Khufu's son and successor, Ra (about 2566 - 2558 BC), did not complete his pyramid at Abu Rawash.\r\nHe was succeeded by Khafre (ca. 2555 - 2532 BC), during whose reign he carved the Great Sphinx and built a pyramid nearly the size of his father's pyramid. As for the two temples connected to the pyramid, they were larger and more detailed than the temples of its predecessors.\r\nThe pyramid of Menkaure (2532 - 2503 BC), son of King Khafre, is considered an example of the beginning of the decline of royal authority. Although his pyramid was considerably smaller than its predecessors, at least a quarter of it was covered in granite, a stone brought from Aswan that was difficult to obtain and transport. Moreover, the temples adjacent to his temple are relatively larger than their predecessors, indicating a shift in the king's priorities from his tomb to the worship to be practiced in these temples.\r\nThis trend grew more pronounced during the Fifth Dynasty (ca. 2449 - 2487 BC) and the Sixth Dynasty (ca. 2345 - 1821 BC). The last king of the Fifth Dynasty, Unas, ordered the creation of inscriptions inside his pyramid at Saqqara, known as the Pyramid Texts, an introduction to a famous series of texts known as the Book of the Dead. The purpose of these texts was to help the king successfully reach the afterlife and become a deity.\r\nBeginning in the Sixth Dynasty it became clear that the king's authority had declined. In addition to other factors, by the end of the long reign of its last king, Pipi II (c. 278-2184 BC), Egypt was no longer under the control of a central government.");

The Eleventh Dynasty came from Thebes (now Luxor). It was not an important city during that period, but it will become one of the most prominent and important cities in Egypt during the rest of ancient Egyptian history\r\nBecause of his Theban origins, Nebhepetre-Mentuhotep was buried on the western mainland of Thebes in the Deir el-Bahri area. His tomb included a temple for his funeral rituals. The tomb was partly cut into a rocky slope, while part of it was built in the form of a terrace that included an ascending middle slope. This temple was clearly a partial inspiration for the neighboring and more famous temple of Queen Hatshepsut to its immediate left.\r\nLittle is known about Mentuhotep III and IV, the last rulers of the Eleventh Dynasty. Amenemhat I (1985-1955 BC) was the first king of the Twelfth Dynasty (1985-1795 BC) and was probably the vizier of Mentuhotep IV. The kings of this highly successful dynasty consolidated the authority of the central government over all of Egypt, and during this period the powerful provincial rulers were reined in.They also undertook building projects throughout the country, strengthened its borders, sent mining expeditions, and encouraged trade voyages. A series of forts, such as those at Bohn, Semna and Ascot, not only served as defensive fortresses but regulated the movement of incoming Nubian traders and were bases for mining and military operations. The reign of Kings Senusret III (1874-1855 BC) and Amenemhat III (1850-1808 BC) was particularly prosperous.\r\nHuge agricultural projects were implemented during that period, especially in the Fayoum region in Central Egypt, where canals were dug, part of the lake was dredged, and the resulting lands were reclaimed for agriculture. The kings of the Twelfth Dynasty in this region were buried in huge pyramids near the new capital founded by Amenemhat I, which was called Etet Tawi, meaning the Holder of the Two Lands, and its exact location is still unknown.\r\nThe Middle Kingdom represented an important shift in the history of ancient Egyptian culture, as its most important contributions to ancient Egyptian language and literature were: new linguistic structures emerged and many new literary texts were written, many of which remain popular for more than a millennium. The language used to write these texts, with its grammatical rules, is called the Middle Egyptian language, which will serve as the language of official texts until the Ptolemaic era (332-30 BC) and the Roman era (30 BC - 395 AD).");
