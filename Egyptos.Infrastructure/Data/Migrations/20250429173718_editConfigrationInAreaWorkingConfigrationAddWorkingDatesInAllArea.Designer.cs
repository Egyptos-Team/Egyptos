                            Description = "Colossal statues are one of the hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, and the Great Sphinx of Giza is the most famous of them. The statue was carved into the rock of the same area during the Fourth Dynasty (c. 2613-2494 BC), making it the oldest. Ancient Egyptian sphinxes represented the king with the body of a lion as a clear sign of his power. Evidence suggests that the Sphinx was carved during the reign of King Khafre (c. 2558-2532 BC), the owner of the second pyramid of Giza. The Sphinx and its temple in front of it are located directly next to the Valley Temple of Khafre and the lower part of the ascending causeway leading to his mortuary temple and pyramid. Careful archaeological analysis has revealed that the Valley Temple was completed before work on the Sphinx and its temple began, while analysis of the Sphinx’s facial features has revealed striking similarities to statues of King Khafre.The Sphinx has captured the imagination of travelers and explorers for thousands of years, even in ancient Egypt.During the Eighteenth Dynasty(c. 1550–1295 BC), it came to be seen as a manifestation of the sun god, and was called Hor - em - akhet, “Horus of the Horizon.” King Amenhotep II(c. 1427–1400 BC) built a temple next to the Sphinx dedicated to this god.His son, Thutmose IV(c. 1400–1390 BC), erected a huge stela between its forelegs, called the Dream Stele, in which he recorded a remarkable event.    The Sphinx was constructed around 2500 BCE during Egypt’s Old Kingdom, specifically during the reign of the Fourth Dynasty. This period is known for the construction of the pyramids and other massive architectural projects that demonstrated Egypt’s advanced engineering and artistic capabilities.Today, the Great Sphinx of Giza is a symbol of ancient Egypt’s enduring legacy. It attracts millions of visitors each year and continues to be studied by archaeologists and historians. The statue remains a source of fascination due to its age, symbolism, and the mysteries that still surround it One of the most famous features of the Sphinx is its missing nose. There are many theories about how it was lost. Historical records suggest that the nose might have been deliberately destroyed. One theory attributes the damage to cannon fire during the Napoleonic era, while another suggests that it was broken off by a Sufi mystic in the 14th century who saw it as a symbol of idolatry. The statue also shows signs of erosion, likely caused by wind, sand, and water over the millennia. Despite these damages, the Sphinx remains remarkably intact for its ageThe Great Sphinx of Giza stands as a timeless testament to the skill, artistry, and spiritual beliefs of ancient Egypt. Whether viewed as a symbol of royal power, a guardian of the pyramids, or a relic shrouded in mystery, the Sphinx continues to captivate the world with its imposing presence and enigmatic history. Its legacy endures, reminding us of the brilliance and complexity of one of the world’s greatest ancient civilizations.   Efforts have been made in recent years to preserve the Sphinx from further erosion and damage. Conservation projects aim to stabilize the structure and protect it from the harsh desert environment.  The Sphinx was likely carved directly from a single massive limestone outcrop that was present on the Giza Plateau. It served as a guardian figure, protecting the sacred site where the pyramids were built. Many historians and archaeologists believe that the Sphinx was intended to stand as a powerful sentinel that would ward off evil spirits and intruder.",

                            Description = "The first attempts to find the well were in 1991, as part of the excavation mission of Zagazig University inside the Bastet temple, and then the head of the mission announced the discovery of the well in 1997.This well follows the Roman architectural style, but many pottery vessels dating back to the period from the first to the fourth century AD were found inside it The Roman Well is a fascinating structure that showcases the advanced engineering and architectural prowess of ancient Rome.Wells were essential to Roman cities, military camps, and fortifications, providing a reliable water supply for drinking, irrigation, and sanitation. These wells, built with incredible precision and durability, have withstood the test of time and remain significant archaeological landmarks today.Roman wells were often constructed using stone, bricks, or concrete.The materials used varied depending on the location and availability, but the goal was always the same: to create a deep, stable structure that could access underground water sources. Some notable features of Roman wells include: Circular Design: Most Roman wells were circular to provide structural prevent collapse. Stone or Brick Lining: The walls were lined with stone or bricks to prevent soil erosion and keep the water clean.Pulley System: A system of pulleys, ropes, and buckets was often installed to draw water more efficiently.Drainage and Overflow Channels: To prevent flooding, Roman engineers designed channels to drain excess water The accounts and sources related to the journey of the Holy Family also stated that the family members drank from this well when they arrived at the city of Tell Basta, which the Holy Family entered on the 24th of Bashans according to the Coptic calendar, corresponding to the first of June, which is still celebrated by Christians in Egypt and the world on that day every year. In Roman times, wells were more than just practical structures; they held symbolic significance as sources of life and sustenance.Wells were sometimes associated with religious rituals and were believed to be connected to underground deities or spirits.Offerings, including coins and small objects, were often thrown into wells as part of religious practices.  The sophisticated construction of Roman wells is a testament to the ingenuity and skill of Roman engineers. Their techniques have influenced well-building practices for centuries and laid the foundation for modern water management systems.Today, many ancient Roman wells still stand as monuments to Rome’s enduring legacy in architecture, engineering, and urban planning.They remain a subject of archaeological interest, providing valuable insights into how ancient civilizations managed water resources in challenging environments.",

Called the Eastern and Western Cemeteries after their locations in relation to the Great Pyramid, they include the tombs of members of the royal family and the highest-ranking nobles, and contain some of the finest tomb reliefs from this period.The Eastern and Western Cemeteries reflect the social and religious practices of ancient Egypt during the Old Kingdom.Burial near the king’s pyramid was a symbol of prestige, as ancient Egyptians believed that closeness to the pharaoh would offer spiritual benefits and enhance their chances of achieving a favorable afterlife.The careful organization of these cemeteries and the construction of mastabas and tombs indicate the importance of maintaining social hierarchies,even in death. Moreover, the decorations and inscriptions found in these tombs provide valuable insights into the daily lives, religious beliefs,and funerary customs of ancient Egyptians.Scenes depicting offerings,hunting,feasting,and religious ceremonies highlight the importance of both worldly pleasures and preparation for the afterlife.The Western Cemetery,located to the west of the Great Pyramid, is larger and primarily contains the tombs of high - ranking officials,priests,and courtiers who served the pharaohs.Unlike the Eastern Cemetery,which focused on royal family members,the Western Cemetery served as a burial ground for the elite who were close to the king in life and wanted to maintain that closeness in death. The Eastern Cemetery is situated near the Great Pyramid of Khufu(Cheops) and primarily contains the tombs of members of the royal family and high officials from the Fourth Dynasty(circa 2600–2500 BCE).This cemetery reflects the importance of proximity to the king’s pyramid, as ancient Egyptians believed that closeness to the pharaoh in death could offer spiritual protection and a better afterlife.The Eastern and Western Cemeteries near the Great Pyramids of Giza are significant burial sites that date back to the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt.These cemeteries serve as a testament to the elaborate burial practices and social hierarchy of ancient Egyptian society.They are located on the Giza Plateau and were constructed to house the tombs of royalty,nobles,and high - ranking officials who lived during the reigns of the pharaohs who built the pyramids. Archaeological excavations in the Eastern and Western Cemeteries have revealed many artifacts,including statues,sarcophagi,and burial goods.These discoveries have helped historians better understand the funerary practices and social organization of the Old Kingdom.Efforts have been made to preserve the cemeteries and protect them from environmental damage and lootingThe Eastern and Western Cemeteries of Giza stand as silent witnesses to the grandeur and complexity of ancient Egyptian civilization.They reflect not only the architectural brilliance of the Old Kingdom but also the deep religious beliefs that shaped every aspect of Egyptian life and death.Together with the Pyramids of Giza and the Great Sphinx, these cemeteries form part of one of the most awe - inspiring archaeological complexes in the world Most of the tombs were mastabas,with some tombs carved into the rock.The term “mastaba” refers to a type of funerary structure that was generally rectangular in shape and built over a burial chamber, which was underground.Most of the mastabas of the Eastern and Western Cemeteries were built during the reign of King Khufu, along with his pyramid complex, while the rock - tombs were built later.",

A path lined with sphinxes leads to the Serapeum, which consists of two long corridors that once contained the remains of mummified bulls. The Serapeum was used from the reign of Amenhotep III in the New Kingdom until the Ptolemaic period.The priests chose the Apis bull based on the presence of distinctive marks on the animal.These bulls received many privileges during their lifetime,and upon their death they were mummified and placed in huge stone coffins in a grand ceremony.The Serapeum was constructed during the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep III(circa 14th century BCE) and later expanded by other rulers,including Rameses II.It served as a necropolis specifically for the Apis bulls,who were seen as living embodiments of the god Ptah, protector of Memphis.When a bull died,it was mummified and given elaborate funerary rites before being interred in a sarcophagus inside the Serapeum. The Apis bull held immense religious importance in ancient Egypt.It was believed to be the living incarnation of the god Ptah and was associated with fertility,strength,and kingship.The death of an Apis bull was a momentous event, followed by elaborate mourning rituals,mummification,and burial.The Serapeum was rediscovered in 1850 by the French archaeologist Auguste Mariette,who stumbled upon the entrance while excavating the Saqqara necropolis.His discovery was groundbreaking and revealed the extent of ancient Egyptian religious practices and funerary customs. Inside the Serapeum Mariette found the massive sarcophagi and numerous artifacts,including statues,amulets,and votive offerings.Many of these items are now housed in museums around the world,including the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the Louvre in Paris.The Serapeum symbolized the close connection between the gods and earthly rulers.By burying the Apis bulls in such an elaborate necropolis,the Egyptians hoped to ensure the bulls' immortality and continued protection for the pharaoh and the kingdom.The name Serapeum derives from Serapis, a Graeco - Egyptian deity whose worship became popular during the Ptolemaic era.  The Serapeum of Saqqara is one of the most mysterious and fascinating ancient structures in Egypt.Located near the Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara,it served as a burial site for the sacred Apis bulls,which were worshipped as manifestations of the god Ptah in Memphis,the ancient capital of Egypt.The Serapeum reflects the Egyptians’ deep religious devotion and belief in the divine connection between humans, animals,and the gods. Inscriptions record many kings making offerings to the Serapeum, as two of Ramesses II's sons, Khaemset and Merneptah, donated many bulls, treasures, and ushabti statues to the Serapeum.",

Although originally faced with blocks of fine limestone, its core consisted of small blocks of local limestone and pebbles, which meant that when the cladding was removed in ancient times, the pyramid was unable to maintain its shape, making it look little different from a natural mound today. However, the interior is intact. It is entered by a descending passage leading to a horizontal corridor, which leads to an anterior chamber. There are three storage chambers on the left, but these were found empty as a result of the pyramid being robbed in ancient times. On the right, on the western side, is the burial chamber, whose ceiling is decorated with golden stars on a dark blue background, reflecting the ancient Egyptian idea of the tomb as a miniature of the universe. The end of the corridor, as well as the front chamber and the burial chamber, are decorated with the Pyramid Texts, a set of rituals and recitations to ensure the king's safe passage to the afterlife. The inscriptions on the pyramid are not complete, indicating the king's sudden death. In the 3rd century BC, the ancient Egyptian priest and historian Manetho recorded that Teti was killed by his guards, but there is insufficient evidence to support this. Some remains of the mortuary temple of Teti's pyramid complex have been discovered, although most of its parts were stolen in antiquity, and the valley temple has yet to be found. There is also a large cemetery for the burial of Teti's officials in front of his pyramid, containing a group of the most magnificent and beautiful tombs of the Old Kingdom, such as the mastabas of the viziers Mereruka and Kagemni.",

With a smaller base, the original pyramid is only 65 metres high, making the pyramid of Menkaure the smallest. This small size was due to several factors, including the small space left on the Giza Plateau, and the materials used for the outer casing of Menkaure's pyramid. His predecessors used limestone to cover their pyramids, while Menkaure used granite brought from Aswan, more than 800 km from Giza. This material was much harder to transport than limestone. However, only the lower quarter of the pyramid is covered with granite, while the rest of the pyramid is covered with limestone. As was the case with the Great Pyramid, three smaller pyramids can be seen next to Menkaure's pyramid, which were used to bury the queens of his time. However, his pyramid was never discovered, but it is believed that the largest of the three queens' pyramids was the pyramid.",

Had it been completed, it would have been the largest obelisk ever constructed, standing at an estimated height of 42 meters (137 feet) and weighing approximately 1,200 tons. This obelisk provides crucial insights into the techniques, tools, and challenges faced by ancient Egyptian stonemasons. The site has been preserved to protect the ancient quarry and ensure that future generations can learn from this incredible monument to ancient engineering. The Unfinished Obelisk was likely commissioned during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut (circa 1507–1458 BCE), one of ancient Egypt’s most powerful rulers. However, the project was abandoned due to a major flaw in the granite – a large crack that developed during the quarrying process. The incomplete obelisk was discovered in the early twentieth century after being covered in sand for thousands of years in one of the Aswan quarries famous for its hardness and high quality. It is likely that the sculpting of this incomplete obelisk began at the behest of Queen Hatshepsut (c. 1473 - 1458 BC) to erect it in front of the Temple of Amun in Karnak, but work on the lying obelisk was stopped after many cracks appeared in the stone.",

Therefore, ancient kings often sent armies and trade missions to the island until it became a port for ships and sea crews, especially those heading to Nubia.\n\nThe island contains hundreds of inscriptions, memorial plaques, and royal cartouches that immortalized many rulers and kings within the boundaries of the temple of the goddess Anket. The most famous inscription on the island is the 'Famine Stela,' which tells the story of a seven-year drought during the reign of King Djoser and his efforts to restore prosperity to Egypt.\n\nSuhail Island has long been associated with the ancient Nubian region, serving as a cultural and commercial crossroads between Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa.

It was built by Sultan Al-Mu'ayyad Sheikh Al-Mahmoudi between 818-824 AH / 1415-1421 AD on Al-Mu'izz Li-Din Allah Street, on the ruins of the 'Khazanat Shama'il' prison, named after Prince Alam Al-Din Shama'il, the governor of Cairo during the reign of King Al-Kamil Ayyubi. The reason behind Al-Mu'ayyad building this mosque is that he was imprisoned in that prison before becoming a sultan, so he vowed during his imprisonment that if God saved him and he took over the rule of Egypt, he would build a mosque instead of the prison. Al-Mu'ayyad Sheikh fulfilled his promise, so he demolished the prison and built a congregational mosque after he became sultan of Egypt. When the Ottoman Sultan Selim I visited this mosque, he said about it, 'Truly, it is the building of kings.' The mosque has four facades, the southeastern facade is the main facade, and the main entrance is located at its eastern end. The mosque consists of a courtyard with an ablution fountain in the middle. The courtyard is surrounded by four prayer halls, the largest of which is the Qibla hall. Two domes were built on either side of the Qibla hall, one of which was destroyed and the other remained. Sultan Al-Muayyad and some of his sons were buried in one of these domes, while the other was designated for the women of his family. Al-Muayyad added other facilities to the mosque, including a bathhouse on the western side. He also built the mosque adjacent to Bab Zuweila and used the gate's two towers as bases for the mosque's two minarets, which were built in the Mamluk style and decorated with geometric engravings.",

He commissioned various architectural projects, including mosques, madrasas (Islamic schools), and this bathhouse. The construction of the hammam was part of Sultan Inal’s efforts to enhance the infrastructure and urban life of Cairo. Inal’s Bath was designed to reflect both the practical and aesthetic values of the time, incorporating advanced engineering techniques for water heating and distribution, as well as artistic elements like colorful tiles and geometric patterns. Like many historical hammams in Cairo, Sultan Inal’s Bath has suffered from neglect and urban development over the centuries. However, efforts have been made to preserve the structure and its unique architectural features. Conservation projects aim to stabilize the building, restore damaged areas, and document its historical significance. Sultan Inal’s Bath is a remarkable example of Mamluk-era public architecture that highlights the importance of hygiene, social life, and architectural innovation in medieval Cairo. Its traditional layout, advanced heating system, and role as a social hub make it a fascinating part of Egypt’s Islamic heritage. Though time has taken its toll on the structure, its historical and cultural significance endures as a symbol of the grandeur of the Mamluk Sultanate. Today, remnants of the hammam still stand as a testament to Cairo’s rich Mamluk heritage. Though it is no longer in operation as a functioning bathhouse, it remains an important historical site that reflects the advanced engineering and artistic achievements of the Mamluk period. The Hammam Sultan Inal (Sultan Inal’s Bath) is a historic Mamluk-era bathhouse located in Cairo, Egypt. Built during the 15th century by Sultan Al-Ashraf Inal, this hammam (public bath) is an architectural gem that showcases the advanced water and heating systems, intricate decoration, and social significance of bathhouses during the Mamluk period. It served not only as a place for bathing but also as a center for relaxation, social gatherings, and purification rituals. Built by Sultan Al-Ashraf Abu Al-Nasr Saif Al-Din Inal in 861 AH/1456 AD as part of the social welfare facilities serving the public in the Mamluk era, Sultan Inal's bath follows the layout of Islamic baths. It consists of a broken entrance leading to the cold room, where clothes are changed to prepare for bathing, interspersed with a number of seats for sitting and cabinets for storing personal belongings. The bather then moves to the warm room to drink and relax before entering the hot room, 'the bathtub.' The exit follows the reverse path to gradually adjust body temperature upon leaving. The Muslim architect used shallow domes in both the cold and hot rooms to maintain the circulation of hot air, and the domes were also provided with colored glass openings to illuminate the place. Water flows into the bathhouse through a well connected to a waterwheel that lifts water to the stove behind the bath. Garbage was collected as fuel, and a fire was lit to heat the water in a huge pot, which was then pumped to different rooms through a system of clay pipes and metal taps.",

Located in Wadi El Natrun (Nitria Valley) in the Western Desert, it dates back to the 6th century CE and has served as an important religious, cultural, and spiritual center for both Coptic and Syriac Christians. This monastery is renowned for its ancient manuscripts, beautiful frescoes, and rich history, reflecting the deep ties between the Egyptian Copts and the Syriac Christian community. The main church in the monastery is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and contains magnificent murals. The sanctuary is topped by a dome decorated with biblical scenes, including the birth of Jesus Christ. The Syriac Monastery was established during the early Christian period when monasticism was flourishing in Egypt. It is believed to have been founded by Coptic monks but later became closely associated with the Syriac Orthodox Church after a community of Syriac monks settled there in the 8th century CE. These monks brought with them a rich collection of Syriac manuscripts and contributed to the monastery’s unique cultural blend. Monastic life at Deir al-Surian is characterized by prayer, fasting, and manual labor, in keeping with the traditions of early Christian monasticism. The monastery follows the Rule of St. Pachomius, one of the founders of communal monastic life in Egypt. Deir al-Surian is part of the monastic complex in Wadi El Natrun, which also includes the Monastery of St. Macarius, the Monastery of St. Bishoy, and the Monastery of the Romans (Deir al-Baramus).

Over the centuries, the Sultan Qaitbay Complex faced challenges, including neglect, urban encroachment, and environmental damage.

The school consists of a central courtyard surrounded by four iwans. The most important features of the school are the main entrance decorated with colored marble and various inscriptions, the entrance door decorated with openwork copper works, and its graceful and beautiful minaret bearing the name of the muezzin at its entrance, as the school’s muezzin was skilled in stone engraving.

In addition to its massive size, it is the first pyramid built by the ancient Egyptians and the oldest known stone structure. The Step Pyramid of Djoser, located in Saqqara,Egypt, is one of the most important monuments in the history of architecture and ancient Egyptian civilization.It is considered the world’s first large - scale stone structure and the earliest pyramid built in Egypt.This iconic structure was constructed during the 27th century BCE, during the reign of Pharaoh Djoser(also spelled Zoser), the second king of Egypt’s Third Dynasty. Pharaoh Djoser ruled Egypt during the Old Kingdom period(c. 2670 BCE – 2640 BCE).His reign was marked by political stability and architectural innovation.The Step Pyramid was designed by Imhotep, a brilliant architect, engineer, and high priest,who is often credited as the world’s first known architect.Imhotep’s innovative design marked a significant departure from the traditional mastaba tombs used to bury earlier pharaohs The Step Pyramid was not just a tomb but a symbol of Djoser’s divine power and eternal life.It was designed to protect the king’s body and serve as a gateway for his soul to ascend to the heavens.The pyramid’s stepped design likely represented a stairway to the afterlife,aligning with ancient Egyptian beliefs about the journey of the pharaoh’s soul. The Step Pyramid of Djoser is credited to Imhotep, who was later deified for his contributions to architecture, medicine, and science.Imhotep’s innovative use of stone construction and his ambitious vision set a precedent for the later pyramids, including the famous pyramids at Giza. Over the millennia, the Step Pyramid suffered from natural erosion, earthquakes, and neglect.However, it has undergone extensive restoration efforts to stabilize its structure and preserve its historical integrity. The Step Pyramid of Djoser remains one of Egypt’s most iconic monuments and a must - visit site for tourists and history enthusiasts.Visitors can explore the pyramid and its surrounding complex, gaining insight into ancient Egyptian beliefs,architectural innovations,and the legacy of Pharaoh Djoser Imhotep. The site offers a fascinating glimpse into the early stages of pyramid construction and the religious and cultural practices of the Old Kingdom of Egypt.In 2020,after a lengthy restoration process, the Step Pyramid was reopened to the public, allowing visitors to explore its magnificent architecture and learn about its historical significance. The Step Pyramid also marked a shift in royal ideology, emphasizing the pharaoh’s divine status and his role as a mediator between the gods and the people. The surrounding complex, with its ceremonial spaces and chapels, was intended to support the king’s continued spiritual existence and provide a setting for offerings and rituals The Step Pyramid was constructed as a royal burial complex and intended to ensure Djoser’s journey to the afterlife, in keeping with ancient Egyptian beliefs about death and rebirth. The construction of the Step Pyramid dates back to the beginning of the Third Dynasty, during the reign of King Netrekht (c. 2667-2648 BC), now known as Djoser, which is more commonly known. Before his reign, Egyptian kings and elite were buried in mastabas, the term mastabas refers to a type of funerary building that was generally rectangular in shape and built over a burial shaft, which was underground. The Step Pyramid consists of six mastabas that give it a stepped shape, and the architect Imhotep was the owner of this great innovation. At one end of the pyramid complex is a building known as the Southern Tomb, which is a symbolic tomb for King Djoser, perhaps reflecting his role as king of Upper and Lower Egypt. The pyramid complex contains some distinctive elements. The courtyard in front of the pyramid was used for the Sed festival, a celebration symbolizing the king's rejuvenation and renewal of his strength. The stone shrines on the eastern side of the courtyard were used for this celebration, ensuring that the king would remain eternally rejuvenated.",

The pyramids were not merely tombs but symbols of the pharaoh's divine power and his connection to the gods.They were meticulously designed, reflecting the ancient Egyptians' advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics. Researchers believe that the workers who built them were not slaves but rather teams of skilled artisans and farmers who worked on the project during the Nile’s flood season when agriculture was halted. The method of constructing the pyramids remains a mystery, but theories suggest that they used long ramps or sleds moistened with water to reduce friction while dragging the massive stones.",

The Karnak Temple was dedicated to the worship of the god Amun-Ra, the principal deity of ancient Egypt, alongside his wife Mut and their son Khonsu, forming what is known as the Theban Triad. The temple is an immense complex that includes many pylons and subsidiary temples.One of its most prominent structures is the Great Pylon, built by Pharaoh Nectanebo I, which leads to the Avenue of Sphinxes—an avenue lined with sphinx statues with ram heads.This path connected Karnak to the Luxor Temple and was used during grand religious festivals such as the Opet Festival.Inside the temple, the famous Hypostyle Hall stands as a true architectural marvel.

It served as the principal royal burial ground for the pharaohs of the New Kingdom (18th, 19th, and 20th Dynasties), who ruled Egypt between the 16th and 11th centuries BCE. The valley is located on the west bank of the Nile near the city of Luxor and is part of the sacred Theban mountains. It was chosen as a burial site due to its natural landscape, which provided protection against tomb robbers and environmental factors. The valley contains more than 60 tombs carved into the rock, some of which feature beautifully preserved decorations and colorful inscriptions depicting scenes of daily life, religious rituals, and the journey to the afterlife according to ancient Egyptian beliefs. The primary reason for selecting the Valley of the Kings as a burial site was to safeguard the tombs from looting.Unlike the pyramids, which were highly visible and frequently plundered, these tombs were carved into remote cliffs to keep them hidden.Despite these precautions, most of the tombs were eventually robbed, with the notable exception of King Tutankhamun's tomb, which was discovered intact by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922. This discovery provided the world with a rare glimpse into the wealth of the pharaohs and their beliefs regarding the afterlife.The tombs in the valley vary in complexity; some are small and simple, while others, such as the tombs of Ramesses VI and Thutmose III, are intricately decorated with detailed inscriptions from funerary texts like the Book of the Dead, the Book of Gates, and the Book of Caverns.These texts were intended to guide the pharaoh’s soul on its journey to the afterlife.One of the most magnificent tombs is that of Seti I, renowned for its vibrant paintings and deeply carved inscriptions. In modern times, the Valley of the Kings has become a major destination for tourism and archaeological studies, with ongoing excavations continuously revealing new secrets.Despite the passage of thousands of years, the valley remains a testament to the architectural brilliance of the ancient Egyptians and their profound concern with the afterlife, reflecting their meticulous preparations for eternity.",

Designed by the brilliant architect and high priest Imhotep, this pyramid marks a revolutionary shift in funerary architecture, transitioning from traditional mastaba tombs to stepped pyramid structures. The Step Pyramid consists of six distinct layers stacked atop one another,  reaching a height of approximately 60 meters.It was originally encased in smooth limestone, though much of this outer layer has eroded over time.Surrounding the pyramid is an extensive mortuary complex, including temples,courtyards,  and ceremonial halls,  all enclosed within a massive limestone wall.This entire structure was designed to serve as an eternal resting place for Djoser, ensuring his transition to the afterlife in accordance with ancient Egyptian religious beliefs.What makes the Pyramid of Djoser particularly significant is its role in shaping the later pyramid - building traditions of Egypt.It laid the foundation for the grand pyramids of the Fourth Dynasty,including the famous Pyramids of Giza.Additionally, the complex is a testament to the advanced engineering skills of the ancient Egyptians, showcasing precise stone - cutting techniques and a deep understanding of construction principles. Despite being over 4, 600 years old, the Step Pyramid remains one of Egypt’s most visited and admired sites.Extensive restoration efforts have been carried out to preserve its structure, allowing modern visitors to witness the architectural genius of Imhotep and the grandeur of one of the earliest and most influential monuments of ancient civilization.",

Located in southern Egypt near the modern border with Sudan, these temples were carved directly into the mountainside during the 13th century BCE (19th Dynasty) to commemorate Ramses II’s victory at the Battle of Kadesh and to assert Egypt’s dominance over Nubia. The complex consists of two temples: the Great Temple dedicated to Ramses II himself and the Small Temple dedicated to his beloved wife, Queen Nefertari.The Great Temple is a masterpiece of ancient engineering and art.Its façade features four colossal statues of Ramses II, each standing about 20 meters tall, seated in a commanding pose.The temple’s interior is equally impressive, with grand halls adorned with detailed reliefs depicting Ramses II’s military triumphs,religious rituals,and divine status.One of its most extraordinary features is the solar alignment phenomenon: twice a year,on February 22 and October 22, sunlight penetrates the temple’s sanctuary, illuminating the statues of the gods Ptah, Amun - Ra, Ramses II(deified), and Ra - Horakhty—except for Ptah,associated with the underworld, who remains in darkness. The Small Temple, located nearby, is dedicated to Queen Nefertari and the goddess Hathor.Its façade showcases six statues—four of Ramses II and two of Nefertari, a rare honor as queens were usually depicted much smaller than pharaohs.The temple’s interior is adorned with elaborate carvings of Nefertari in the presence of deities, emphasizing her divine status and the deep affection Ramses II had for her. One of the most remarkable aspects of Abu Simbel’s history is its relocation. In the 1960s, the construction of the Aswan High Dam threatened to submerge the temples under Lake Nasser.In an extraordinary UNESCO - led rescue operation, the temples were carefully cut into massive blocks and reassembled 65 meters higher and 200 meters back from their original location, preserving them for future generations. Today, the Abu Simbel Temples stand as a testament to ancient Egyptian architectural genius, the might of Ramses II, and the global efforts to protect humanity’s cultural heritage.The site continues to attract visitors from around the world, marveling at its grandeur, historical significance, and the incredible feat of its preservation.",

The theater was discovered in 1960 during excavation work, revealing a well-preserved structure that offers valuable insight into the architectural and cultural life of ancient Alexandria. The amphitheater consists of 13 semicircular rows of white marble seating arranged in a horseshoe shape, supported by granite columns.These rows could accommodate around 600 spectators and were designed for optimal acoustics, ensuring that sounds projected from the stage could be clearly heard throughout the venue.The structure originally featured a domed roof, enhancing its acoustics, though only remnants of this remain today.The seats are inscribed with Greek letters, possibly marking designated spots for specific individuals, suggesting its use for official gatherings, musical performances, and theatrical productions. Beneath the seating area, excavation has uncovered intricate mosaic floors and remnants of an underground passage, which may have been used by performers or staff during events.Additionally, the site contains a collection of ancient artifacts, including statues and decorative elements, indicating that the theater was part of a larger cultural and administrative center. During later periods, particularly in the Byzantine era, the function of the structure evolved, and it was possibly used for public assemblies or as a council hall. The surrounding archaeological site also includes Roman baths, a residential district, and lecture halls, reinforcing Alexandria’s status as a major intellectual and cultural hub in antiquity. Today, the Roman Amphitheater of Alexandria stands as a testament to the city's rich Greco-Roman heritage. It is a popular tourist attraction and an important site for historians and archaeologists studying the intersection of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman influences in ancient Alexandria.",

Although the site has older origins dating back to the Old Kingdom, the current temple structure was built during the Ptolemaic and early Roman periods, between 125 BCE and 60 CE, with contributions from rulers such as Ptolemy XII and the Roman Emperor Tiberius. The temple is renowned for its elaborate carvings, vibrant ceiling decorations, and astronomical significance.The hypostyle hall, with its 24 massive Hathoric columns topped with carvings of the goddess’s face,leads into a series of chambers,sanctuaries, and chapels.The ceiling of the temple is one of its most striking features, covered in detailed astronomical depictions,including a zodiac map that showcases the constellations and celestial cycles.The famous Dendera Zodiac, now housed in the Louvre Museum, was originally part of this temple. One of the temple’s most intriguing elements is the so - called Dendera Light relief,located in the crypts beneath the structure.Some researchers speculate that these carvings represent ancient electrical technology,although most Egyptologists interpret them as religious symbols related to creation and rebirth.Dendera is also home to the rooftop chapels,offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.These chapels were used for rituals associated with the goddess Hathor, and their walls contain inscriptions illustrating the temple's religious functions. Nearby, the mammisi (birth house) commemorates the divine birth of the child god Ihy, reinforcing the temple’s association with fertility and renewal. The temple complex includes additional structures such as a sacred lake,a Roman - period gate,and remnants of Coptic Christian occupation,illustrating its continued significance through different historical periods.Today,the Temple of Dendera stands as one of the most well - preserved and richly decorated monuments of ancient Egypt, drawing visitors and scholars alike to admire its intricate artistry and deep spiritual symbolism.",

By hugging the coast of the bay, the ships traveled to the Canopic branch of the Nile and transported their goods to all of Egypt. Pottery sherds and amphorae were found scattered on the bay’s seabed, a testament to the many shipwrecks that took place here. The artifacts testify to the flourishing trade between Egypt and the world. A survey of the seabed revealed an ancient Roman shipwreck, remains of which are still present today. Little is known about Mamoura Bay, but excavations are gradually providing us with information on the area. A small port and paving dating to the Greco-Roman Period were found, along with the limestone quarry that was used to build them. Rock cut basins were also discovered and are thought to be evidence of fish farming, raising the possibility of a settlement that was once located here",

The ship was 50 meters long and was carrying about 900 tons of cargo. Excavations revealed that the ship was carrying Chinese Qing Dynasty porcelain that was fashioned for the Middle East. Many spices were also found aboard the ship including pepper, cardamom and nutmeg from India; frankincense from Oman; as well as, coconuts, olives and hazelnuts among other things.

Today, the remains of the city have been submerged under the Mediterranean Sea. The most prominent monument from the harbor was the Pharos Lighthouse that was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter I in 297 B.C, and that was a landmark in the ancient city. The lighthouse stood 130 meters tall and had a beacon that guided ships to the port from up to 50 kilometers at sea. The beacon consisted of a fire that was reflected off of a massive bronze mirror. The lighthouse deteriorated with time and after an earthquake in the 14th Century, it collapsed. Recent excavations at the harbor discovered a marble floor believed to be part of Cleopatra’s palace. A temple to Isis, sphinxes and statues were also found at the harbor submerged on the seabed. Continued excavations at the site will undoubtedly reveal a lot more.",

According to biblical tradition, it is believed to be the mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God.The mountain is famous for its spectacular sunrise and sunset views, attracting thousands of visitors who embark on the challenging hike to the summit. There are two main routes to reach the top:The Camel Path (Siket Sayidna Musa) – A longer but easier route with a gradual incline, often used by those riding camels partway.The Steps of Repentance (Siket El Bashait) – A more challenging route with 3,750 stone steps, carved by monks centuries ago.At the summit, visitors find a small chapel and a mosque, both commemorating the site’s religious importance. The view from the peak is breathtaking, offering a panoramic view of the surrounding mountains under a sky that turns fiery red, orange, and gold at sunrise.At the base of Mount Sinai lies the Saint Catherine’s Monastery, one of the oldest Christian monasteries in the world, built in the 6th century. It houses ancient manuscripts, mosaics, and the Burning Bush, which, according to tradition, is where God spoke to Moses.Mount Sinai is not only a religious site but also a paradise for hikers, adventurers, and nature lovers. The rugged landscape, the tranquility of the Sinai Desert, and the spiritual atmosphere make it an unforgettable destination.",

It is historically significant as one of Egypt’s most famous sources of red and pink quartzite, a stone that was used extensively in ancient Egyptian temples, statues, and obelisks.Dating back to Pharaonic times, Gabal Ahmar was one of the primary quarries where hard quartzite stone was extracted and transported along the Nile River to be used in monumental structures such as temples, pyramids, and royal tombs. Some of the most famous artifacts carved from Gabal Ahmar quartzite include statues of Amenhotep III and Ramses II.The mountain itself is not very high, but its deep red-hued rock formations give it a striking appearance. Over centuries, extensive quarrying has changed its shape, leaving behind rugged cliffs and exposed rock faces that tell the story of ancient Egyptian stonework.Today, Gabal Ahmar is partly urbanized, with modern developments surrounding the area, but it remains an important archaeological and geological site. Researchers and archaeologists continue to study the quarry to learn more about ancient Egyptian stone-cutting techniques and construction methods.Although not a traditional tourist destination for hiking or climbing, Gabal Ahmar is a fascinating site for those interested in ancient Egyptian history, geology, and archaeology.",

These villages are home to the indigenous Nubian people, one of Egypt’s oldest and most culturally distinct communities, whose history dates back thousands of years to the time of the ancient Kingdom of Kush. The Nubians have preserved their unique traditions, language, and architectural style despite historical challenges, including displacement following the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s, which led to the flooding of Old Nubia and the loss of many ancestral lands. Today, Nubian villages are known for their vibrant, colorful houses painted in bright blues, yellows, and pinks, often adorned with intricate murals depicting scenes of daily life, geometric patterns, and religious symbols. The villages are characterized by a warm and welcoming atmosphere, where visitors are greeted with traditional hospitality, including offers of hibiscus tea, fresh dates, and local delicacies. Nubian culture is deeply rooted in music and dance, with traditional instruments such as the tar and tambour playing a central role in celebrations, while folklore and storytelling remain essential aspects of community life. Visitors can explore local markets filled with handcrafted jewelry, woven baskets, and textiles, often featuring bold patterns and bright colors reflecting Nubian aesthetics. One of the best ways to experience the villages is by taking a felucca or motorboat ride along the Nile, offering stunning views of the palm-fringed shores, golden sand dunes, and the lush greenery that contrasts sharply with the arid desert landscape. Many visitors also stop at Heissa Island, one of the last remaining inhabited Nubian islands, where they can learn about the community’s efforts to preserve their heritage and sustainable way of life. Beyond their cultural richness, the Nubian villages serve as gateways to some of Aswan’s most famous landmarks, including the majestic Philae Temple, dedicated to the goddess Isis, and the colossal Abu Simbel Temples, relocated stone by stone to save them from being submerged by the rising waters of Lake Nasser. The natural beauty of the region is equally mesmerizing, with golden sands meeting the deep blue of the Nile, making it a perfect place for relaxation and photography. The Nubian people take great pride in their identity, and their villages remain one of the best places in Egypt to experience an authentic, living culture that has endured for millennia. Whether exploring the narrow alleys lined with hand-painted houses, engaging in lively conversations with locals, or enjoying a traditional Nubian meal, a visit to the Nubian villages offers a deeply immersive and unforgettable experience into one of Egypt’s most vibrant and historically significant communities.",

The valley, once covered by a prehistoric ocean over 40 million years ago, holds an extraordinary collection of fossils belonging to the Basilosaurus and Dorudon, ancient whale species that mark the transition from land-dwelling mammals to fully aquatic creatures. These fossils, remarkably intact and often preserved with their vestigial hind limbs, offer definitive evidence of how whales evolved from four-legged land animals into the marine giants of today. The site is also home to fossilized remains of other prehistoric marine life, including sharks, rays, and various shellfish, painting a vivid picture of the region’s ancient ecosystem. The landscape of Wadi El-Hitan is equally breathtaking, featuring vast stretches of wind-sculpted sandstone formations, towering cliffs, and undulating dunes that create an otherworldly atmosphere. Visitors can explore the site via well-marked trails that lead past the largest and most impressive fossils, many of which are displayed in their natural positions. The Wadi El-Hitan Fossil and Climate Change Museum, an eco-friendly visitor center, provides further context with detailed exhibits, interactive displays, and life-size models of the ancient whales, allowing visitors to grasp the immense significance of the findings.

                            Description = "Al-Tod Village is located in Upper Egypt, approximately 20 kilometers south of Luxor, on the east bank of the Nile. This small yet historically significant village is home to the Temple of Al-Tod, an ancient Egyptian sanctuary dedicated to the falcon-headed god Montu, the war deity worshipped primarily in the Theban region. Al-Tod’s history dates back to the Old Kingdom, but it flourished particularly during the Middle Kingdom and the reigns of later rulers such as the Ptolemies and Romans, who expanded and modified the temple complex. One of the most remarkable discoveries from the site is the Tod Treasure, a hoard of silver and gold artifacts of Mesopotamian origin, found beneath the temple’s foundations, suggesting long-distance trade and cultural connections between Egypt and the Near East. Today, the village offers visitors an authentic experience of rural Egyptian life, where traditional mudbrick houses, narrow alleyways, and lush agricultural fields along the Nile reflect a way of life that has changed little over centuries. The local economy is primarily based on farming, with crops such as sugarcane, wheat, and corn cultivated in the fertile lands surrounding the village. Walking through Al-Tod, visitors can observe farmers tending their fields using ancient irrigation techniques, women crafting handmade textiles and pottery, and children playing near the village’s small markets. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, with villagers eager to share their traditions and way of life. In addition to its archaeological significance, Al-Tod provides an excellent opportunity for cultural immersion, where visitors can enjoy homemade Egyptian dishes, listen to traditional folk music, and witness local festivals that celebrate agricultural cycles and religious traditions. The proximity to Luxor makes it a perfect off-the-beaten-path destination for those interested in experiencing Egypt beyond its grand temples and tombs. Whether exploring the ancient ruins of the Temple of Montu, engaging with the hospitable villagers, or simply taking in the serene beauty of the surrounding landscape, Al-Tod Village offers a unique blend of history, culture, and rural charm that makes it a hidden gem in the Luxor region.",

Covering an area of about 7,450 square kilometers, it is one of Egypt’s most diverse and ecologically significant protected areas, boasting a stunning combination of coastal, marine, and desert ecosystems. The park is named after Wadi El-Gemal, or Valley of the Camels, a dry riverbed that once served as an important trade route. Today, the park is celebrated for its breathtaking landscapes, rich biodiversity, and cultural heritage, making it a must-visit destination for nature lovers, adventure seekers, and history enthusiasts alike. The coastline of Wadi El-Gemal features pristine beaches, mangrove forests, and some of the Red Sea’s most vibrant coral reefs, teeming with marine life, including dolphins, dugongs (sea cows), and countless species of tropical fish. Snorkelers and divers can explore the untouched coral gardens near Hamata Islands, while bird watchers can spot rare species such as ospreys and sooty falcons in the coastal wetlands. Inland, the rugged mountains and vast desert plains are home to the endangered Nubian ibex, wild camels, and various reptiles, while acacia trees and desert plants provide a striking contrast to the arid environment. The park also holds significant historical and cultural importance, with evidence of ancient human settlements dating back thousands of years. The region was once a major center for emerald mining during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, and visitors can still see the ruins of the Sikait and Nugrus mines, where Egypt’s prized emeralds were extracted. These archaeological sites, along with ancient inscriptions and petroglyphs left by early travelers, shed light on the area’s long history as a crossroads of trade and civilization. Wadi El-Gemal is also home to the Ababda Bedouins, a semi-nomadic community that has lived in harmony with the desert for generations. Visitors can engage with the local people, learn about their traditions, and experience authentic Bedouin hospitality through guided eco-tours, camel treks, and traditional tea gatherings. Sustainable tourism initiatives in the park aim to protect its fragile ecosystems while allowing visitors to explore its natural wonders responsibly. Whether hiking through its rugged valleys, camping under its star-filled sky, or diving into its crystal-clear waters, Wadi El-Gemal National Park offers an unparalleled opportunity to connect with nature, history, and the timeless beauty of Egypt’s eastern wilderness.",

It is the only museum specialized in the antiquities and civilization of Egypt during the Graeco-Roman periods.Since 1889, the Italian Giuseppe Botti sought to establish a museum for Alexandria to protect its antiquities from displacement and destruction.He continued working on this until the decision to create the museum was issued on June 1, 1892.The museum began in a simple rented property and was inaugurated by Khedive Abbas Helmi II on October 17, 1892, with Giuseppe Botti as its first director.From its inception, the museum achieved a cultural awakening towards archaeological work in the city, leading to increased discoveries and the urgent need for a new, more spacious building.On September 12, 1894, Nubar Pasha laid the foundation stone for a new museum on land owned by and adjacent to the Municipal Council.The new building was designed by architects Dietrich and Steenon in a neoclassical style.Construction took one year, and it was inaugurated again by Khedive Abbas Helmi II on September 26, 1895. After Botti's death in October 1903, the museum's management remained Italian, with Evaristo Breccia taking over in April 1904, followed by Achille Adriani from 1932 to 1940.Alan Rowe managed the museum from 1940 to 1947, and Adriani returned for a second term from 1948 to 1953.Since 1953, Egyptian archaeologists have managed the museum.In 1982, a development project was implemented, adding a new wing connecting the western and eastern wings.In September 2005, a decision was issued to close the museum for a comprehensive expansion and development project.The project was delayed for ten years until work resumed in April 2015.A new design was created with the addition of an upper floor, and a new museum display format was implemented.",

Construction work stalled until it was completed, and a temporary exhibition hall on Egyptian crafts through different eras was opened in 2017, attended by former UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova, showcasing four crafts: pottery, woodwork, textiles, and jewelry. All preparations for the museum's other halls were completed, and His Excellency the President inaugurated the central exhibition hall and received 22 royal mummies transferred from the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir in a grand procession in 2021.

The body was then dried using natron salt and wrapped in linen bandages. Magical amulets were placed within the wrappings around various parts of the mummy to protect the body. Finally, the deceased's family carried the mummy to be placed in a coffin for burial.The Mummification Museum provides a comprehensive explanation of the entire process,detailing the religious significance of mummification and its associated rituals.It displays many of the tools used, as well as a collection of canopic jars,mummified remains,elaborately decorated coffins,amulets,and statues of deities.",

Initially called the Khedivial Riding Service, this name continued until 1922, during the reign of King Fuad I (1917–1936), when it was renamed the Royal Stables Administration. This service was a major focus of interest to the royal palace at the time, which provided it with specialized experts and skilled workers. The building was converted into a historical museum after the 1952 revolution.The museum houses a magnificent collection of royal carriages of various sizes and types,dating back to the reign of the Muhammad Ali Pasha dynasty in Egypt.The most famous of these is the carriage known as the Grand Alai Private Carriage,distinguished by its fine craftsmanship and exquisite decoration.It was a gift from Emperor Napoleon III and his wife, Empress Eugenie, to Khedive Ismail at the time of the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.The king ordered the construction of the building.King Farouk I renovated it and used it at the opening of Parliament in 1924.It also houses a collection of horse harnesses and accessories, as well as clothing belonging to the staff of the Horsemen's Department, whose jobs were related to carriages. It also houses a collection of oil paintings of kings and princesses dating back to the same historical period.

The request was for this furniture and his collection of antiquities to become the property of the Egyptian people after his death or when he finally left Egypt. The committee agreed. As soon as Anderson left the house in 1942, his will was executed, and the two houses and their contents were transferred to the Arab Antiquities Authority, which turned them into a museum named after Gayer Anderson. The house consists of two Ottoman-era houses from the 16th and 17th centuries that were combined into one. The first house was built by the teacher Abdul Qadir Al Haddad in the year (947 AH / 1545 AD), and at a later date its ownership was transferred to Mrs. Amina bint Salem, and the second house was built by Hajj Muhammad bin Salem bin Jalmaam Al Jazzar in the year (1041 AH / 1631 AD), and families succeeded each other inhabited it until a woman from the island of Crete inhabited it, so the house was known as the Cretan House in reference to her.",

The museum aims to display the regional history and many of the artifacts that were discovered in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate. The museum includes three halls, containing the artifacts that were found in the cemetery of Buto the Great and the temple area, where a number of important artifacts were discovered that embody the story of the conflict between Horus and his uncle Set, in addition to other archaeological sites in Kafr El-Sheikh, including a statue of the god Horus the falcon, one of the most wonderful statues discovered in Egypt so far, and is considered a unique copy that is only rivaled by its counterpart in Edfu Temple. A hall in the museum was also allocated to display the artifacts that embody the period when the city of Sakha hosted the journey of the Holy Family during its visit to Egypt, in addition to displaying the history of science during different historical eras such as medicine, veterinary medicine and pharmacy, as well as some topics related to the city of Fuwwah, which has a rich Islamic heritage. It includes all of Kafr El-Sheikh's cultural heritage. Sheikh Zayed is considered the third heritage city after Cairo and Rashid.",

The Ayyubid state was a military state as it appeared during the Crusades in Egypt and the Levant.  In light of this political context, Saladin decided to build a castle in Cairo, which began construction in 527 AH / 1176 AD, but its completion was not completed during his lifetime, but later in 1208 AD. Therefore, the rule of Egypt extended to the Levant, the Hijaz, Yemen, Nubia and parts of North Africa. The Ayyubid era in Egypt lasted for 81 years and ended at the hands of the Mamluks.",

                            Description = "During the New Kingdom, Egypt became a great empire that stretched across the ancient Near East, reaching as far south as the Fourth Cataract in Nubia, and as far north as the Levant. The Egyptian economy flourished to an astonishing degree, and most of the most famous and impressive ancient Egyptian monuments date back to this great period.  The Eighteenth Dynasty (1550-1295 BC) began with King Ahmose, who expelled the Hyksos, a Semitic people who ruled most of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. Most of the kings of the New Kingdom pursued an expansionist foreign policy in response to what had happened before, and the wealth generated by the expansions was used to carry out many construction projects throughout Egypt, especially at the Karnak Temple in Luxor, the most important temple of Amun, the lord of Thebes. Most of the kings of this dynasty were buried in the famous Valley of the Kings.  Art, architecture, and the national economy reached new heights under Hatshepsut. Unfortunately, her husband, Thutmose II, did not rule for long, while his son from another wife, Thutmose III, was still too young to rule. So the Great Royal Wife Hatshepsut, perhaps in order to secure the throne of Egypt, declared herself king alongside her young stepson. Hatshepsut developed a new concept of kingship and linked herself to a divine birth from the god Amun to legitimize her reign, leaving a profound mark on the geographic, religious, and political landscape of Thebes.  Thutmose III proved to be the most capable king of all. During his reign, Egypt’s borders were extended farther, and his influence extended throughout the Nile Valley, including Nubia, leaving many monuments at the Karnak Temple, as Hatshepsut had done before. Peace was achieved in the region during the reign of his son Amenhotep II, and both the state of peace and increased international trade bore fruit under his successor Amenhotep III. Few kings matched him in the quality, scale, and quantity of his building projects, as he built many structures throughout Egypt and Nubia, including half of the Luxor Temple as it stands today.  However, Amenhotep IV, son of Amenhotep III, changed his name to Akhenaten and declared his rebellion against the rest of the gods and that there is only one god, Aten, who was represented as the sun disk in the sky. His reign witnessed other revolutionary changes in royal ideology, art, architecture and language. However, he neglected Egypt's foreign affairs, and by the end of his reign, Egypt's lands in the Levant (the area of ​​Palestine, Lebanon and Syria) were lost.  A turbulent period followed his reign, with Horemheb - a former army commander - ascending to the throne and completing the return of things to normal, appointing the commander Bar-Amesu as his successor. With his ascension to the throne under the name Ramesses I, the Nineteenth Dynasty (c. 1295-1186 BC) began, and his son Seti I succeeded him and ushered in an era of prosperity in Egypt. He also carried out many military campaigns, the most important of which were against the Hittites, who emerged as a new power in the ancient Near East, and regained much of Egypt's lost lands in the Levant.  His son Ramses II the Great was one of the most successful kings in ancient Egyptian history. During his long reign he waged many successful wars, achieved the first peace treaty with the Hittites, and left more monuments throughout Egypt than any other king. Meanwhile, his successor and son Merneptah launched a major attack against tribes called the \"Sea Peoples\", and by the end of his reign the Nineteenth Dynasty declined.  With the reign of King Setnakht, founder of the Twentieth Dynasty (1896-1069 BC), order returned to the country, and his son Ramses III was the last great warrior of the New Kingdom. After him, the state deteriorated steadily until it was divided into two parts. The next dynasty ruled only Lower Egypt, while Upper Egypt remained under the rule of the priests. The New Kingdom",

King Djoser, the first king of the Third Dynasty, built his step pyramid in Saqqara. He wanted to build a mastaba-shaped tomb in the style of his predecessors, the kings of the First and Second Dynasties, but those mastabas increased to reach about five mastabas, one above the other.To be the first stone step pyramid in the country's history. But his successors were unable to complete their pyramids, perhaps due to the short duration of their rule. We do not know much about King Huni, the first king of the Fourth Dynasty, while the second king, Senefru (2613-2589 BC), was very powerful and advanced. He alone built three pyramids, the first of which was in the city of Meidum, which began as a step pyramid and then ended as a complete pyramid. . As for the second, he built it in Dahshur and is known as the Bent Pyramid or the Broken Pyramid. It was the first attempt to build a pyramid.Complete, but its construction was not completed as he wanted, while the third pyramid, known as the Red Pyramid in Dahshur, was the first complete pyramid in Egypt, which opened the way for the construction of complete pyramids. This was achieved during the reign of his successor, King Khufu (c. 2589 - 2566 BC), who built the largest pyramid and pyramid group. The Great Pyramid, with an original height of 146.5 metres, was the tallest building in the world for 3,800 years. Khufu's son and successor, Ra (about 2566 - 2558 BC), did not complete his pyramid at Abu Rawash. He was succeeded by Khafre (ca. 2555 - 2532 BC), during whose reign he carved the Great Sphinx and built a pyramid nearly the size of his father's pyramid. As for the two temples connected to the pyramid, they were larger and more detailed than the temples of its predecessors. The pyramid of Menkaure (2532 - 2503 BC), son of King Khafre, is considered an example of the beginning of the decline of royal authority. Although his pyramid was considerably smaller than its predecessors, at least a quarter of it was covered in granite, a stone brought from Aswan that was difficult to obtain and transport. Moreover, the temples adjacent to his temple are relatively larger than their predecessors, indicating a shift in the king's priorities from his tomb to the worship to be practiced in these temples. This trend grew more pronounced during the Fifth Dynasty (ca. 2449 - 2487 BC) and the Sixth Dynasty (ca. 2345 - 1821 BC). The last king of the Fifth Dynasty, Unas, ordered the creation of inscriptions inside his pyramid at Saqqara, known as the Pyramid Texts, an introduction to a famous series of texts known as the Book of the Dead. The purpose of these texts was to help the king successfully reach the afterlife and become a deity. Beginning in the Sixth Dynasty it became clear that the king's authority had declined. In addition to other factors, by the end of the long reign of its last king, Pipi II (c. 278-2184 BC), Egypt was no longer under the control of a central government.",

Although the Eleventh Dynasty had its origins in the First Intermediate Period, the last king of this era who succeeded in unifying Egypt, thus beginning the Middle Kingdom, was King Nebhepetre Mentuhotep (ca. 2055 - 2004 BC). The Eleventh Dynasty came from Thebes (now Luxor). It was not an important city during that period, but it will become one of the most prominent and important cities in Egypt during the rest of ancient Egyptian history Because of his Theban origins, Nebhepetre-Mentuhotep was buried on the western mainland of Thebes in the Deir el-Bahri area. His tomb included a temple for his funeral rituals. The tomb was partly cut into a rocky slope, while part of it was built in the form of a terrace that included an ascending middle slope. This temple was clearly a partial inspiration for the neighboring and more famous temple of Queen Hatshepsut to its immediate left. Little is known about Mentuhotep III and IV, the last rulers of the Eleventh Dynasty. Amenemhat I (1985-1955 BC) was the first king of the Twelfth Dynasty (1985-1795 BC) and was probably the vizier of Mentuhotep IV. The kings of this highly successful dynasty consolidated the authority of the central government over all of Egypt, and during this period the powerful provincial rulers were reined in.They also undertook building projects throughout the country, strengthened its borders, sent mining expeditions, and encouraged trade voyages. A series of forts, such as those at Bohn, Semna and Ascot, not only served as defensive fortresses but regulated the movement of incoming Nubian traders and were bases for mining and military operations. The reign of Kings Senusret III (1874-1855 BC) and Amenemhat III (1850-1808 BC) was particularly prosperous. Huge agricultural projects were implemented during that period, especially in the Fayoum region in Central Egypt, where canals were dug, part of the lake was dredged, and the resulting lands were reclaimed for agriculture. The kings of the Twelfth Dynasty in this region were buried in huge pyramids near the new capital founded by Amenemhat I, which was called Etet Tawi, meaning the Holder of the Two Lands, and its exact location is still unknown. The Middle Kingdom represented an important shift in the history of ancient Egyptian culture, as its most important contributions to ancient Egyptian language and literature were: new linguistic structures emerged and many new literary texts were written, many of which remain popular for more than a millennium. The language used to write these texts, with its grammatical rules, is called the Middle Egyptian language, which will serve as the language of official texts until the Ptolemaic era (332-30 BC) and the Roman era (30 BC - 395 AD).",

In the ancient capital of Memphis, Greek settlers established their settlement around the main temple of Ptah in the early Ptolemaic period.

This is the period in which Egypt emerged as a unified political entity, making it the oldest country in the world Before the formation of the Egyptian state and during the Neolithic, an increasing homogeneity can be seen between the different civilizations that emerged along the Nile Valley, with those civilizations being named after their original sites.

Like the rest of its contemporaries, Naqada I reveals little about social stratification, but this changed by the end of this period. This trend became more evident during Naqada II (ca. 3500 - 3200 BC), which began to spread along the Nile Valley. Among the most important Naqada II sites, besides Naqada itself, were Hierakonpolis (Kom el-Ahmar) near Edfu, and Abydos in Upper Egypt. During the Naqada III civilization (ca. 3500 - 3100 BC),The community continued to grow more complex and diverged from and politically separated itself from contemporary Nubian culture. The transition from the Naqada III civilization to the early dynastic period was smooth, which is why Naqada III is sometimes called the “Zero Dynasty.” It appears that the powerful regional leaders during this period already controlled most, if not all, of the land of Egypt. There was a difference between Upper and Lower Egypt geographically. This difference remained apparent until the late prehistoric era, and the ancient Egyptians did not forget this matter throughout their ancient history despite the unity.
